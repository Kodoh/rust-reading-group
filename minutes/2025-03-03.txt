Everyone arrived in a timely manner, Michael presented Chp 1-2
Julia will present next week (Chp 3-4)
We specically discussed:
  - Libraries vs Modules vs Traits
  - Cargo Lock
  - "Deprecation" of Rng
We still want to explore: traits, references, macros.

Julia will take notes and create a teams channel for further communication. Or maybe a discord.
